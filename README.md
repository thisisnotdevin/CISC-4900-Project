## Description of the project:
Many people struggle to find places to go out, places to eat, and find the "top things to do in NYC" to be oversaturated. The project is a website that allows visitors and locals to find anything in New York City, from enjoyable activities to top-notch restaurants and rooftop bars. Hidden gems that nobody has talked about. The website has a sign-in system, allowing each user to have their own account. On our website, we'll have personalized preferences for various users, allowing each one to see recommendations based on their prior preferences. This website aids those who are having trouble choosing a destination or finding things to do.
## Objective:
Besides all the famous places like the Statue of Liberty and Broadway, it can be difficult to find what you're looking for. Our website can assist both tourists and locals to find the perfect activities.

` Example: Your friends from Canada visit you for the summer, and you want to take them out to a fun place in NYC. However, they have already visited all the well-known locations, including Broadway, Times Square, and the Statue of Liberty. When you search for "top things to do in New York City," they all direct you to the same crowded tourist spots, despite the fact that you want to take them somewhere new. Our website will show unique places that allow the user to easily pick activities to do.`

Meetings weekly:
Mondays 9:00 pm-11:00PM
Wednesdays 9:00 pm-11:00PM
Fridays 9:00 pm-11:00PM
Project details:
## What is the goal?
Because New York City is such a touristic destination, the popular places are often crowded with tourists, and locals have a difficult time finding places to go because there are so few options online when searching for things to do in New York City. We want to create this website so that we can assist both locals and tourists in visiting unusual places that are fun and inexpensive. Our website is created to save individuals time when determining where to go, whether to eat, have fun, or go out with friends or family. 
Another goal for our website is that it can help you save time and money by providing detailed information about each event, including the date, time, location, and cost. This can help you plan your schedule and budget effectively, so that you can make the most of your time and resources in NYC.

## What are some of the features?
	The ability to display special events that are now and will occur in the future is one unique feature of our website. That option is not available on other websites like TripAdvisor and Yelp. Furthermore, New York City frequently hosts events that are only temporary for a week, such as Japanese festivals, carnivals, comic cons, and many other events occur just for a few days, and those who are unaware of these may miss out on a fantastic opportunity to view these attractions. Our website will immediately update any new events that occur so that no one misses out on any of them. 

## What challenges will we solve? / how did we improve the system?
One of the main issues with teenagers is that they struggle to find events to attend, whether they are with friends or family. Moreover, they want more information than simply the location or event's name; they want to know what will be there, what will be available nearby, how much it will cost, etc., thus we want to provide them a concise description so they will know what to anticipate.

## Who is our audience and how will it benefit them?
The audience for our website could be anybody ages ranging from 8-65 (this is an estimate). This means that our design and functions must be simple and understandable to any 8 year old or 65 year old, once we cover those two ranges, it should be easily understandable to anybody in between. Additionally, not everybody will be from NYC; We have to provide them information on how to access transportation, places to avoid when busy, etc. 
Besides helping tourists, our website is also designed to help people that live in New York City. Many people often struggle to find a place to go out with their friends or a date, many activities that they have seen or heard about but don‚Äôt know where it is or if it is even still there. One more important benefit is that it will be able to show future events so people can plan according to their schedule.
## How will this website be built?
### Language
The website will use HTML to construct and display the web browser, CSS to add design and style to the HTML pages, and Javascript as the central component to connect and create all of the website's features. For user functions and data storage, we will also use PHP and SQL as additional languages. However, we are still choosing to test out new building blocks like React JS or backend storage like Firebase based on our time constraints.

### Schedule & Work
We determined that it is most efficient and beneficial to set out a few hours a week to have a group meeting and talk about our process and keep ourselves updated because the members of our group have widely different schedules, some people have work while others have classes. In addition, members work independently to contribute to this project; all modifications are logged on an open-access Google doc.
Since our group members have different skills and strengths in different sectors of computer science, we are discussing the most optimal way to divide work. The member with the most experience with a certain process will work on that part, and work is divided among others the same way.

### Data, Information, News
There are many sources for news, events, restaurants, activities in NYC, our team will focus on specific ones that have the most accurate information. Sources can come from other websites, news, instagram posts, and many more. Making sure to design a system that only displays events once is important because we run the risk of receiving duplicate events when gathering data from various sources and posting them twice on the website. 
	Our initial task for this section is to find the most efficient way to gather data from other places, perhaps some fetching API, or web scraping from a website. In the future, our team will research if there is a more efficient way of doing this process.

### Design
Our UI (user interface) which are all the visual elements are going to be very simplistic. We believe that making it simple can also be visually appealing to the users and also less work on our end. That includes easy to read text and clear navigation buttons. Speed is important because our website should not be slow, we have to design it so it can handle a large traffic of users and information coming and going, however this task is for the future. We also need to make sure to use a secure database that keeps user information safe, users should not be able to access other people‚Äôs information through our website.
Useful website for the figures https://undraw.co/illustrations quality illustrations available for our designs with customisable color(s), objects that can be combined and modified to create new exciting images and with a design style that balances art and tech to our website. For the map that we implemented on the main page of our website, we used the API from google, https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript


### Planning
Professional website design can make or break a company. A well-designed website can be a powerful tool for branding, customer engagement, and lead generation. The first impression of your website can impact how potential customers view your business. Is your website accessible on mobile devices? Does it load quickly and appear professional? How user-friendly is it? Will potential customers find what they're looking for? These are all important questions to consider when evaluating the effectiveness of your company's website. Website design may not seem like a very technical field, but there are many considerations when creating a site from scratch or updating an existing one. A poorly designed site can hurt brand recognition, drive visitors away, and send search engine ranking plummeting.



### Projects objectives before the Second Draft:
	Having fully set up a working user sign up and register page, after that will be the board or map of activities and events. It doesn‚Äôt have to be fully functional yet, we will build the interface (HTML & CSS) first, when everything is ready we will implement the javascript part. By this point we should already have the idea of how to gather information for our website and what tools to use. Additionally we should have decided how our page will look like.




## Obstacles and Risks:
### Time 
For now, our team might face time constraints due to many members having work and outside of school activities, we are trying to accommodate enough time to contribute every day. The website should promptly display events so that visitors can see the most recent ones and make plans in advance. To make sure that the information is accurate and current, this might necessitate using real-time data or updates from event organizers.
Users should be able to filter or sort events on the website by date and time so they can quickly find events that work with their schedule. This might necessitate a user-friendly interface and effective search and filtering tools on the website.Users should be able to save or bookmark events on the website so they can easily access them in the future. This might necessitate the website having a user account system and the capacity to save user preferences.

### Design 
We currently have many designs in mind and we have to choose which one will fit our goal the most. Besides that we also have to have an idea of how to implement it, a design out of our capability will take us too much time. 


### Here is a list of goals we have in mind for the design:
Use a straightforward, contemporary layout that is simple to read and navigate. Users will find the information they're looking for more quickly and simply as a result.

To highlight the events and create a visually appealing website, use high-quality pictures and graphics. This can draw visitors and improve user engagement on the website.

Effectively use color and typography to give the website a unified, branded look. By doing so, the website can develop its identity and differentiate itself from other event websites. We are planning to use colors in the color palette below.

Make the website mobile-friendly and responsive so that users can access it from any platform. This is crucial because many users now use their smartphones and tablets primarily to access the internet. However we might face difficulties implementing this step because the components in our website might get messed up when scaled differently.

Overall, designing a website to gather NYC events is about creating a user-friendly and visually appealing experience that helps users find and learn about the events they are interested in.

### Purpose for a user profile
Users will have preferences, and our website will display events based on those preferences after they create accounts and respond to questions. Additionally, users can favorite the events that they want to visit in the future, so it does not get lost. 
### Updates
We have finished laying the groundwork for our website, and the map is ready and able to move and look at different locations. The user can choose what they want to look at in the map by using the event type buttons underneath the map. Once they choose it, a number of events will appear on the map, and they can click the markdown to view more information about the event. Additionally, if a user searches for a location, the location's details are displayed on the map.
	After the first draft, we have completed the navigation bar and each option has a functioning page and we have also updated our pages to the following format:
HomePage - Map, Tabs, Overall Styling 
Contact Page - Developer Info (Mock Data) 
First Time - Intro, Survey to set preference base on user answer, Redirect to registration or Home page 
Q&A - Basic Q&A 
Profile - Personal Info, Preference Settings, History, Saved Events 
FeedBack - Reports Issues, Suggestions, Other 
Login Page - Create Account,  Forgot Password or Username 
Registration - Takes user info and stores it in database, Checks for existing account conflict
### Changes
We had originally intended to research locations in every borough, but doing so would have required more planning, designing, and coding, all of which would have taken a lot of time. Additionally, we determined that since Manhattan is the best place to visit in New York City, it would be better if we concentrated our activities there. We added a few questions for users to answer once they sign in so we can learn about their preferences. Once a user signs in, we can then display events based on their preferences. Additionally, users have the option to change events, view their information, and view saved events later on their profile.
We originally planned to use firebase as our back-end for the user login interface but our team decided to use mamp since it's more convenient. Based on the members' level of programming expertise, we have described the task to be worked on and divided the work between them. Under tasks we can see each member‚Äôs name next to the task they are working on to avoid confusion. Our project makes extensive use of the Google Maps API, which makes it simple for us to look up location searches and related information.



### Projects objectives before the Final Version:
Have event details show up on the right side, events can be sorted based on rating, price, location distance, etc. it should also show event details on the markdown inside the map so the user can easily look through every point. 
Have a functional login system and when the user first creates an account, they will tackle a quick survey to show their preferences and then the website shows events based on the preferences.
Other important things that need to be fixed are putting FAQ on top of the feedback page so the users can understand how to navigate through the website. Fix the positioning of things to adjust based on the website scale, and also for the mobile scale.


## Website Design
### Main page design 
### Map	
	We used a google maps API to create and project the main map on the front page. A "searchInput" input element where the autocomplete addresses will be added. Created a display on Google Map, with a DIV element called "map." The chosen elements will show on the geolocation information. The Google Maps JavaScript API uses the Places library, so we have to specify an API key in the parameter. 
A map is included to make it simpler for users to browse events and restaurants, as well as to visually show them what is nearby. We intend to use small tables that appear when a user hovers over a location to display useful details like the type (food, attraction, museum, fitness) and operating hours, possibly along with the busiest times.
Along with the map, we listed a variety of events below it for the user to choose from. These events covered music, culture, the outdoors, food, health, entertainment, and attractions. We will soon implement a feature that allows users to view momentary events, also known as pop-up events.

The map is produced using the "initMap()" function of the Google Maps API, which is centered on Manhattan, New York. The map features four basic map types (roadmap, satellite, hybrid, and terrain). It is also linked to the search bar at the top of the website; when a user types a query, results from the autocomplete built-in feature appear on the search bar and a marker is placed on the map. The autocomplete feature provided by the Places API gives our applications the same type-ahead search functionality as the Google Maps search field. Autocomplete will fill in the remaining information once the user begins typing an address. Every time a location is looked up, a marker is produced. When the user clicks on the marker, information about the location, including its name, its address, and category, will appear.
	The map is loaded into the HTML with a script tag, it can also be dynamically added using a javascript file, on the script tag there must be an api key in order for it to function. In order for the mpa to load, we must reserve a spot for it, for that we place a <div> with an id of ‚Äúmap‚Äù in the main HTML page. 
	
### Categories	
The user can choose what they want to see on the map and filter out everything else by using the categories boxes that are located beneath the map. It involves sending an API request for the types or keywords present in the requested location, and then after that information has been obtained, placing a market on the map. The callback function takes the results and generates content for each marker, displaying the location's name, cost, rating, and address. The results are also shown on the right side of the map after selecting a category. The original design had pictures inside the marker, but we decided to create a separate section for it because it appeared too crowded.
With the google API places library it was very easy to search for places with all their information, for our project we only focused on specific aspects of the place, such as their name, vicinity(address), rating, and price, there are other components that we did not include such as the open and close hours, phone numbers, website, reviews because we want to make it as minimal as possible. For every category, there is a limit on how many places it will show up, this basically 
There is a cap on the number of locations that can be displayed for each category, which gives the user the impression that there aren't many options. For example, if a user searches for restaurants and sees every restaurant in Manhattan, it will be very difficult for them to choose, so only a few results will appear. By selecting the same category once more, you can update it and get fresh information.
### Results	
On the right side of the map is where you'll find the results box. It displays all of the results for the chosen category along with the location's most pertinent image. The process involves using an array that reads all of the chosen results and creates elements on the html page for each one with the location's name, address, and cost. The box will be cleared, by using the ‚ÄúclearBox()‚Äù function, to make room for the new results if the user chooses to select a different category. 
When a user selects a category, markers appear on the map and a description of the location appears in the result box. The foreach loop used in this process creates an element containing each place that was returned by the original function from the categories in the results array. It builds in the infoBox its place.name, price, and place.vicinity.
When a user selects a category under the map, the resultbox function would use the Google Maps API to fetch the location of each event and display it on the result box. The map would show the location of the event, as well as nearby landmarks, streets, and points of interest. However when the user clicks on a place inside the resultbox a pin will appear on the map marking the location of that place and nothing else. We have assumed that this task would take a certain amount of time, but in reality, it took longer due to unforeseen challenges or complications. This caused us to fall behind schedule and not have enough time to finish the project on time.

### Explore	
The explore button is a feature on our website that lets users navigate and discover trending events in NYC. When a user clicks on the explore button, they are taken to a page that displays a list or grid of the most popular or relevant events in the city. The events may be sorted by category, date, location, or other criteria, and users can use the website's search and filtering tools to find the events that are most interesting to them. 
The explore button is located on the homepage or navigation menu of the website, next to the map, and it provides users with an easy and convenient way to discover new events and activities in NYC. By clicking on the explore button, users can quickly and easily browse through the latest events and find ones that match their interests and preferences. 
Overall, the explore button is a useful and user-friendly feature on a website that gathers trending events in NYC, as it allows users to easily discover and learn about the events happening in the city, without having them to manually search throughout all of the events.


## Events page design

## About page design
### About
	The About page simply consists of 3 cards, the first card briefly describing the background and the purpose of this website. It mentions how it offers a more authentic and unbiased alternative to the typical Google recommendations, which are often sponsored or influenced by advertising or other commercial interests. Unlike typical search engines or directories, our website focuses on showcasing the most unusual and unexpected places in the city, such as hidden courtyards, secret bars, and underground clubs, etc. 
The second card consists of services we used for our project, which is the Google Maps API, a collection of programming tools that allows us to integrate Google Maps functionality into our own websites. We used the Google Maps API to retrieve information about events that are happening in a given area. Another service we used was FormSubmit which will be explained in the feedback section. 
Lastly, the third card will highlight the members of our team and the important contributions that each person made to make this project a reality. This card will give recognition to the hard work and dedication of each individual. It will serve as a testament to the collective effort and collaboration that went into creating this project, and will serve as a reminder of the effort and dedication that each member put forth. 
Feedback page design
Feedback section
Users can leave comments, suggestions, and ratings about their experience with the website. This section consists of a form, located on the bottom of the feedback page or survey that users can fill out, along with a comments section where users can post their thoughts and opinions. This is an essential component because it enables users to offer insightful comments and suggestions that can help the website develop and improve. And we as the designers and managers can learn important information from the feedback page about what people like and hate about the site, as well as what they would like to see modified or added.
Users can use the feedback page to share their thoughts and experiences with the website, such as by commenting on the website's design, functionality, and content. They can also rate the website on various aspects, such as its usefulness, user-friendliness, and relevance to NYC events. The user has the choice to select what type of feedback he wants to provide, a comment, bug, or other. Once the user has filled out the feedback box and has pressed submit, the user will be redirected to a FormSubmit site which is a feature that is used on websites to collect and process user-generated data.
When a user fills out and submits a form on our website, the FormSubmit feature processes the user-generated data and sends it to the website's business email. This allows the website to store and manage the data, and use it for various purposes, such as responding to user inquiries, tracking user preferences, and generating reports.
FormSubmit is a very common and helpful feature on many websites, which enables users to quickly and conveniently submit information and feedback while also enabling the website to collect and manage data effectively. 

### FAQ
	A FAQ, or Frequently Asked Questions, is a section on a website that provides answers to common questions and queries from users. The purpose of a FAQ is to help users quickly and easily find information and solutions to their questions, without having to contact the website's support team or search through long and complex documents. For example, a FAQ on a NYC events website could provide users with tips and advice for finding the best events and venues in the city, as well as insider information and secrets about the events and their organizers. Overall, a FAQ is a useful and potentially interesting feature on a website, as it can provide users with valuable information and insights, and it can reflect the website's unique personality and culture. We have included the FAQ in the feedback page and on top of the feedback submission form in case it answers questions, so the user doesn't have to submit a form.
