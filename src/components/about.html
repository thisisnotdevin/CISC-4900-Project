								<p class="text">Many people have trouble finding places to eat and go out, and residents of New York City believe 
									they have already been to the "best" places in Manhattan. Our website offers directions so users can locate unique 
									experiences. <strong> Not the typical</strong> Google recommendations because those locations may be sponsored and 
									frequently have long lines. 
								</p>
								<p>Our website can have a more specialized and focused focus on events in the city, providing 
									users with a curated and comprehensive list of events that is specifically tailored to the NYC area. In contrast,
									 Google may include events from all over the world, making it more difficult for users to find events that are relevant and interesting to them.</p>

							<h3>Services and features</h3>
							   <p class="text">All locations were discovered and collected using the <strong>Google Maps API</strong>; however, we chose to concentrate 
								on a small range in Manhattan because we think it offers the ideal balance of beauty and entertainment. Future plans call 
								for adding the choice of various boroughs. For our website, we only chose locations with online reviews and images and 
								filtered out the ones with none because people are afraid to visit a place without them.
